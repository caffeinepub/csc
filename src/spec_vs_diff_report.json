  "summary": "Diff primarily adds SPA fallback/static files for routing (404.html and admin/index.html) and adjusts frontend routing logic for /admin (including trailing slash). It also includes substantial backend/main.mo changes around inquiries, access control checks, and user profile management that are not clearly tied to the deployment/publish error fix from REQ-13.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "A production (live) publish completes successfully without deployment errors; both backend canister and frontend assets build successfully as part of the live publish pipeline.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code/content changes but does not include build/pipeline configuration changes or any evidence (e.g., build scripts, deployment config, CI logs) demonstrating that the production publish/deployment error is resolved and that both backend and frontend build successfully in the live publish pipeline.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "After live publish, the main site loads successfully and the hidden /admin route still renders the admin page.",
      "reason": "The diff improves routing behavior for /admin and adds fallback pages, but it does not provide deploy/runtime evidence that production routing actually serves these assets correctly after publish (e.g., asset canister routing behavior/config).",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/expanded backend user profile management (get/save caller profile, profile access checks).",
      "reason": "REQ-13 is scoped to investigating/fixing a production deployment error when publishing Draft Version 2 live; it does not request new backend user profile functionality.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added/expanded backend inquiry functionality (public inquiry submission, internal admin-only inquiries, admin-only retrieval including getAllInquiries/getPublicInquiries, additional inquiry fields such as internal/read).",
      "reason": "REQ-13 does not ask for new inquiry features; these appear to be product functionality additions beyond the deployment-error fix.",
